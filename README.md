#LAB4 3 OCTOBER 2025 Part 3: A small Python project
#For this wrap-up project, we aim to develop a Python application that reads the above picture (available as a .png file) in low resolution, 
#to generate a scalable version (generated as a .svg file) that can be used as a high-resolution wallpaper for any computer. The application should, therefore, 
#read an input file (file.png)   and produce an output file (file.svg) that one can open and render with any compatible application
